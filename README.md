## Hi there, I'm Oleh Zubariev 👋

I am a sophomore Computer Science and Math double major at Texas Christian University🐸🟣. I love learning more about coding through personal projects and I'm always excited to take on new challenges. 

🔭 I’m currently working on a web design project for a nonprofit "Indigenous Institute of the Americas"
⛅ I've recently posted my first Android App "WeatherNOW". Make sure to check it out!
⚡ Fun fact: I love collecting colorful socks
